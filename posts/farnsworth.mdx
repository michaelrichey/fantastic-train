# OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

She also liked to shut up! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'll get my kit! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

Professor, make a woman out of me. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. **That's right, baby.** _I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much._ You even love anyone pretending to be him!

## I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Pansy.

1. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
2. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
3. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

### Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

- Kif might!
- Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
- Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Now what? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I can explain. It's very valuable.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Kif might! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! It doesn't look so shiny to me. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Now what? Why did you bring us here? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Say what? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

Professor, make a woman out of me. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! And I'm his friend Jesus.

Moving along… Your best is an idiot! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
