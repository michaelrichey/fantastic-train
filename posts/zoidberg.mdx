# I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

Soothe us with sweet lies. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. **Fry, we have a crate to deliver.** _Oh Leela!_ You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

## Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Who are those horrible orange men? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

1. Shinier than yours, meatbag.
2. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
3. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

### We're also Santa Claus!

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

- Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
- Now what?
- Really?!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. You are the last hope of the universe. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Daylight and everything. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. That's not soon enough! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Is that a cooking show?

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. With gusto. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Ummm…to eBay? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Belligerent and numerous. So, how 'bout them Knicks?

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Shut up and get to the point!

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Who are you, my warranty?! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I'm Santa Claus! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
