# In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? **They're like sex, except I'm having them!** _We're rescuing ya._ Now what?

## Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

1. Belligerent and numerous.
2. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
3. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

### It's a T. It goes "tuh".

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. We don't have a brig.

- In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
- Tell her she looks thin.
- Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

You lived before you met me?! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Say it in Russian! I'm Santa Claus!

I can explain. It's very valuable. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

But I've never been to the moon! You are the last hope of the universe. Professor, make a woman out of me. That's not soon enough! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

I'm Santa Claus! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Who am I making this out to? We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Oh sure! Blame the wizards!

We're rescuing ya. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Belligerent and numerous. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

It's toe-tappingly tragic! Is that a cooking show? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. And then the battle's not so bad?

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
